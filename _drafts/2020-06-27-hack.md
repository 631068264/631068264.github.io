So the given file was a hexdump. I used xxd -r <filename> to reverse it and sent the output to a file. I kept using file command at each step to know what I’m tackling.
gzip compressed files are extracted using gunzip. But gunzip extracts files only with certain extension, .gz being one of them. So I renamed the file to have that extension.
bzip2 compressed files are extracted using bzip2 -d <filename> where -d flag stands for “decompress”.
For tar archives I used tar xvf <filename>.
